The standard game of darts.

Points are scored based on where the dart lands. If it
lands in the thin outer ring, the score of the dart is
doubled. If it lands in the thin ring closer to the centre,
the score of the dart is tripled. The centre of the
dartboard, the bullseye, scores 50 points whereas the
ring surrounding it, the outer bull, scores 25.

Each player takes turns to throw 3 darts. At the end of
their turn, the total score of those 3 darts is taken
away from the player's overall score, which starts
from 501. The objective of the game is to make your
score equal to 0. This has to be done by hitting a
double with the dart that you want to score 0. For
example, if you were left with 20, you'd need to hit
10 in the double's ring to win.





Each player must land darts in every number on the board,
from 1 to 20, in order. As soon as a player lands a dart
in the target number, that player can then target the
next number. The first player to finish wins.





The objective of cricket is to 'open' certain numbers on the
board, to achieve the highest score. To open a number, you
must land 3 darts in that number (doubles count for 2
darts, and triples count for 3). Once a number is opened,
any further hits to that number will earn the player points
as normal, until the other player lands 3 darts in that
number, which then closes that number, making it no longer
earn points. The player with the most points and who opens
all the numbers first wins, or if both players are tied on
points, the player who opens all the numbers first will win.

The numbers involved are the 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 and the
bullseye.




At the start of the game, one player is a 'batter' and the
other is a 'bowler'. The batter earns points for each turn
that they score over 40. For example, if the batter scores
39, they will earn 0 points. if they score 50, they will
earn 10 points. To stop the batter earning points, the
bowler must earn 10 points, by hitting either the outer
bull, which is worth 1 point, or the bullseye, which is
worth 2 points. Once the bowler has earned 10 points, the
players swap roles, and play again. The batter who earns
the highest score wins.





1. To aim a dart, press and hold your finger on the phone screen.

2. Slide your finger across the screen until the dart is lined up
to your target. Don't lift your finger from the screen.

3. To throw the dart, either flick your wrist backwards then
forwards in a fast motion, releasing your finger from the screen
as your wrist moves forward, or move your arm backwards then
forwards in a fast motion, releasing your finger as your arm
moves forward.

These controls can take some time to get accustomed to. You can
practice without worry in PRACTICE MODE, which you can access
in the SINGLE PLAYER game menu.

Have fun!
